# project_examples

This repository contains a set of projects carried out during my learning of C++ and Python. In addition, the codes of both the solved exercises and other short projects are available in the cplusplus_lessons and python_lessons repositories.

C++:

1. Calculator: this application was programmed to solve a list of mathematical operations. From the application, a text file containing the list of operations is accessed. Each operation is solved and the solutions are saved in another text file. The complexity of operations is increased by combining the elementary operations of the application (e.g., 57.5 * pi + pow(2,3) - 5! + var1 - sqrt(16)). The defined operations are: +, -, *, /, factorial (!), exponentiation, square root, integers -to operate on ints only-, and help. In addition, in this application both variables and constants can be defined. Operations are parsed using recursion and OOP (the application follows the precedence established in C++). The operations can also be solved through the graphical interface of the calculator. Examples of the calculator's operation are presented after the description of the projects.

2. Vector Template (Buscar proyecto y describirlo): 

Python:

1. Data-Access Layer: in this project, a Data-Access Layer (DAL) was implemented using Python. This DAL was used to access a database managed through PostgreSQL. The information in the database was contained in a table. A set of classes was programmed to interact with this table through CRUD statements. In addition, in this set were included the classes to manage both the connection pool and the user's instructions provided from a terminal.
